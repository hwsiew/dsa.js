# Heap 

Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.

## Heap property
* Max-heap: key of each node is always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes.
* Min-heap: key of each node is always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes.
